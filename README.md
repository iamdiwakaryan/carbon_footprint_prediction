# Problem
Households are significant contributors to global carbon emissions, yet many people do not have a clear understanding of how their daily habits affect the environment. Traditional carbon footprint calculators often miss critical lifestyle factors. By using Machine Learning on synthetic household data, we can estimate carbon footprints more accurately. This approach empowers individuals to make informed, climate-friendly choices. This Earth Day, let's use data-driven awareness to drive real environmental change
# Task
The goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model that estimates the monthly carbon footprint of individual households based on lifestyle factors, household characteristics, energy consumption patterns, and sustainability practices. This model aims to provide personalized insights into carbon emissions, helping households to identify ways to reduce their environmental impact.
